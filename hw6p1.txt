CIS 391 - Homework 6

Experiments:

1. Change case
 - We first decided to remove the restriction that all words should be assumed
   to have the same case. We checked if a word is mostly upper or lower case
   and then just converted it to a word will all capital or all lower case
   letters. This proved to hurt our prediction. The number of spam emails that
   were incorrectly classified increased. We decided not to include this into
   our final classifier.

1. Case analysis
 - We calculated the frequency of words that were all caps in the training
   set and incorporated that into our prediction for an input file. This new
   feature was added to the score in the predict phase for a file.
