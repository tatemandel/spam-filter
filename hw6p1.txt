CIS 391 - Homework 6

Experiments:

1. Change case
   We first decided to remove the restriction that all words should be assumed
   to have the same case. We checked if a word is mostly upper or lower case
   and then just converted it to a word with all capital or all lower case
   letters. This proved to hurt our prediction. The number of spam emails that
   were incorrectly classified increased. We went from 193/200 correct to 
   192/200 correct spam classifications.

2. Case analysis
   We calculated the frequency of words that were all caps in the training
   set and incorporated that into our prediction for an input file. This new
   feature was added to the score in the predict phase for a file. This
   addition increased the number of correct classifications of spam emails
   from 193/200 to 199/200 for our dev set from the test set.
 
   After finishing this feature, we found that adding back in the case change
   from the previous experiment caused no difference any longer. This points
   to the fact that this second feature has greater significance than the 
   case of a few words in the email.

3. Removed email headers
